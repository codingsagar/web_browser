## MAKING OUR OWN WEB BROWSER

### Chapter - 1

* parse a URL into a scheme, host, port, and path
* connect to that host using the socket and ssl libraries
* send an HTTP request to that host, including a Host header
* split the HTTP response into a status line, headers, and a body
* print the text (and not the tags) in the body.


### Chapter - 2 

* talks to your operating system to create a window
* lays out the text and draws it to that window
* listens for keyboard commands
* scrolls the window in response

**I also added page up scrolling as you would in a real browser along with page down scrolling .**





Will be following this [guide](https://browser.engineering/) to make our browser project and implement our own features too.
