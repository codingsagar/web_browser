## MAKING OUR OWN WEB BROWSER
* This will be a interesting project if you love developing things which you use in your daily life like web browser.
* Technologies we will be using mainly will be Python
* Packages like tkinter for GUI, and more will be used (Will update as we progress with this project)
* Will try to implement some unique features and it will be fun and too much learning.


Will be following this [guide](https://browser.engineering/) to make our browser project and implement our own features too.
